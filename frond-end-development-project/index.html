      <p>Dr. Bennet Efeakandu Omalu is a Nigerian-American physician, forensic pathologist and neuropathologist, who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in American football players. Omalu was born in Nnokwa, Idemili South, Anambra in southeastern Nigeria, on September 30, 1968, in the heat of the nigerian civil war. The family name, Omalu, is a shortened form of the surname, Onyemalukwube, which translates to "he who knows, speak." He is married to Prema Mutiso, with whom he has two children. He and his family reside in Lodi, California.</p>
      <p>Dr. Omalu is most known for his research and publications on a disease called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which affected football players at all levels. After his finding and its revelation to the world, Dr. Omalu and his asscociates received a lot of negative feedback from the national football league (NFL), and the american public in general, because his findings threathened the practice and future existence of football, which remains the most popular sport in America.</p>
      <p>In 2016, a movie named "Concussion" was made, starring star actor Will Smith in the role of Dr. Omalu. This movie recounts the tale of his life before, during and after he published his findings on CTE.</p>
